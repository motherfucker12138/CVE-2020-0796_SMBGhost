I've spent two days to make very detailed comments to almost every line of key functions



here is how windows 1903/1803 fucked up when dealing with SMB2 compression-enabled packet



![image-20220608160949690](README.assets/image-20220608160949690.png)



## how illegal address is accessed

**srv2!Srv2DecompressData**:

![image-20220608155925063](README.assets/image-20220608155925063.png)





I never said RCX is smbpacket, what I only know is that `[rcx+0F0h][18h]` is pointed to smb_header

why? because the data in `[rcx+0F0h][18h]` is the same as wireshark!



so now we know, RAX is a pointer which points to smb_header 

![image-20220608160249534](README.assets/image-20220608160249534.png)



now smb_header is saved into `[rsp+30h]`, smb_header is 0x10bytes, so xmmword(0x10bytes width) is enough



![image-20220608160750948](README.assets/image-20220608160750948.png)

we know `[rsp+30h]` is the very first byte of smb_header, so `[rsp+3Ch]` is 0xC offset in smb_header structure, which is `offset/length` field, value of this field is `0xffffffff`



![image-20220608161259341](README.assets/image-20220608161259341.png)

a very big value(`0x000000010000000f`) is calculated here and passed to RDX

![image-20220608161651213](README.assets/image-20220608161651213.png)

![image-20220608162544590](README.assets/image-20220608162544590.png)

then this value is added to RAX (pointer of smb_header), RDX is now pointing to somewhere unknown



![image-20220608161843422](README.assets/image-20220608161843422.png)

as the second parameter, RDX is passed to `srvnet!SmbCompressionDecompress`

**srvnet!SmbCompressionDecompress**:

![image-20220608161919302](README.assets/image-20220608161919302.png)



![image-20220608161929177](README.assets/image-20220608161929177.png)

![image-20220608162040894](README.assets/image-20220608162040894.png)



R9 passed to `nt!RtlDecompressBufferEx2` as the fourth parameter

**nt!RtlDecompressBufferEx2**:

![image-20220608162126342](README.assets/image-20220608162126342.png)

![image-20220608162137992](README.assets/image-20220608162137992.png)



finally, function `nt!guard_dispatch_icall` will call `nt!RtlDecompressBufferLZNT1`

**nt!RtlDecompressBufferLZNT1**:

![image-20220608162239060](README.assets/image-20220608162239060.png)

![image-20220608162257528](README.assets/image-20220608162257528.png)



target system crashed



## why this address is illegal
